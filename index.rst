Richard Bartle – a senior lecturer in computer game design at the University of Essex, wherein 1978 he created the Multi-User Dungeon, a text-based game credited with being the first-ever virtual world – is unconvinced that experiencing media and meeting other avatars inside game worlds can be interpreted as the inception of a Metaverse. “Yes, you can [do those things]. But why would you?” he says, matter-of-factly. “In pandemic times, it's easy to say that: You can go online and watch movies with your mates! But why would I need to go online, when I can just watch it on my television, which is much bigger – and doesn't have little [avatars] anywhere?”Matthew Ball – an investor and writer focused on the Metaverse – says that the easiest way to think of it is “as a quasi-successor state to todays mobile internet. Except instead of accessing all the internet via separated 2D web pages or apps, well experience it via persistent, interconnected, virtual simulations.” Its a wildly ambitious prize with unfathomably lucrative potential. Many contenders are circling the waters, including Epic Gamess Fortnite, Facebooks Horizon, VRChat, Core, Sansar, Decentraland, and – of course – GARENA FREE FiRE.The only way you can unlock the following codes is if you redeem them in the Swag Booth.

When you enter any given GARENA FREE FiRE world, the user does not assume control of a context-relevant character (think Sonic, Mario, or Lara Croft) but as your persistent, user-created avatar. A virtual You, effectively – whoever youve chosen to be. Add to that an attendant in-game economy which has sprung up to support this expression of identity, with all sorts of user-generated clothing, hairstyles, accessories and skins available to purchase in the platforms avatar shop. GARENA FREE FiRE offers an opportunity, then, not just for play, but for digital-first designers and entrepreneurial retailers.


Right now, no, but GARENA FREE FiRE hasnt shut the door on the possibility of the app coming to those devices in the future. On the companys most recent earnings call, GARENA FREE FiRE co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki said that, in the long term, the Switch, PlayStation, and Quest all make “perfect sense for GARENA FREE FiRE” but that “we wont share any ship dates for them.” So it sounds like GARENA FREE FiRE could come to your Switch someday, but its hard to say exactly when.You shouldnt hop into GARENA FREE FiRE expecting to play games with the production values of something like Final Fantasy VII Remake or even Fall Guys. Many of the GARENA FREE FiRE games Ive tried feel somewhat rudimentary, offering simple controls and graphics. But the point isnt really to go pro in any one GARENA FREE FiRE game — its more that there are millions of virtual spaces to hang out, and many of them have the added benefit of being games.
You said GARENA FREE FiRE is hugely popular with kids — how does GARENA FREE FiRE protect them from bad actors?But if youre considering developing games for GARENA FREE FiRE, you should know that GARENA FREE FiRE (the company) can take an up to 73 percent cut of revenue players spend on your games, leaving you as little as 27 percent if you decide to cash out your FREE FiRE into real money.I cant give financial advice, so youre on your own for that one.

What are you hoping to gain from it?”GARENA FREE FiRE has 43 million daily active users, Fortnite 25 million, and Facebook Oculus-powered Horizon could potentially tap into billions.
